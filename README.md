# Project Summary: 
InsightEye is a real-time eyesight testing system that combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. It captures and analyzes visual behaviors such as eye movements and fixation points to provide an accurate and objective measurement of an individual's eyesight health. The system can detect and classify different visual patterns in real-time and provide immediate feedback to the user or healthcare professionals. The NLP component further analyzes the data generated by the computer vision algorithms to offer insights into the individual's eyesight health status. This paper presents a novel approach to combining computer vision and NLP technologies for real-time eyesight testing.

# Problem Statement:
In low-income and underprivileged regions, limited access to eye care services and resources leads to an increased risk of vision impairment, blindness, and related health complications. The scarcity of trained eye care professionals, particularly in rural areas, further aggravates the problem, leaving numerous individuals without sufficient support for their visual health requirements. To tackle this challenge, it is crucial to devise innovative, accessible, and cost-effective solutions that guarantee equitable access to high-quality eye care services for all.
InsightEye empowers individuals to make informed decisions about seeking professional care. This system also supports healthcare professionals in remote settings by facilitating early intervention and diagnosis. With its user-friendly design, InsightEye democratizes access to high-quality eye care services, fostering awareness, early detection, and prompt treatment of vision-related issues. Ultimately, this contributes to the global endeavor to diminish preventable blindness and vision impairment..

# Project Objective:
### Real-time detection and classification
### Remote monitoring
### Support early detection of vision-related issues.
### Enhance eye care accessibility in low-income and underserved areas.
### Maintained the User Eyesight Health history.
